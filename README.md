# TwitterBot Assignment

A Markov Chain-based AI for generating tweets. This project parses CSV data, trains a Markov Chain model, and uses it to generate realistic tweets based on the training data.

## Features

- **Markov Chain Model**: Generates tweets using a probabilistic language model.
- **CSV Parsing**: Reads and processes training data from CSV files.
- **File I/O**: Handles input and output for training and generated tweets.
- **Customizable**: Easily train the bot on new datasets.
- **Dynamic Tweet Generation**: Produces unique, contextually relevant tweets based on input data.
- **Efficiency**: Processes large datasets and generates tweets quickly.

## Requirements

This project is written in Java. Ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 17 or later
- JUnit 5 for testing

## Files

- `MarkovChain.java`: Core implementation of the Markov Chain model, including methods for building the state transition table and generating text.
- `TwitterBot.java`: Main class for interacting with the bot, including loading training data and generating tweets.
- `CSVParser.java`: Utility class for reading and processing CSV files, ensuring data cleanliness and compatibility.
- `TwitterBotTest.java`: Unit tests for verifying the correctness of the Markov Chain model, CSV parsing, and tweet generation.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitterbot.git
   ```

2. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

3. Run the TwitterBot:
   ```bash
   java TwitterBot <training_data.csv> <number_of_tweets>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   java TwitterBot training_data.csv 5
   ```
   This generates 5 tweets based on the `training_data.csv` file.

## Tests

Run the unit tests using JUnit:
```bash
java -jar junit-platform-console-standalone-1.8.2.jar --class-path . --scan-class-path
```

The tests verify:
- Proper parsing and handling of CSV data.
- Accurate generation of tweets based on the Markov Chain model.
- Edge cases, such as empty or malformed input files.

## How It Works

1. **Training**: The bot reads a CSV file containing tweet data, splits the content into words, and builds a state transition table (Markov Chain).
2. **Generation**: Using the Markov Chain, it selects a starting word and constructs tweets one word at a time by following probability distributions from the training data.
3. **Output**: The generated tweets are printed to the console or saved to a file.

## Example Output

With training data from a dataset of tweets, the bot may generate:
```
"I love coding and coffee in the morning!"
"Learning Java is so much fun with Markov Chains."
```

## Customization

You can customize the bot to:
- Use different datasets by providing a new CSV file.
- Adjust the number of tweets generated by changing the `<number_of_tweets>` parameter.
- Modify the Markov Chain order (e.g., bigrams or trigrams) to improve contextual accuracy.
